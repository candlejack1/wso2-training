# What is an API?

  

## API definition

  

**API** stands for Application Programming Interface and describes how to interact with a program.

  

This can be seen as some form of contract that specifies that if you provide a program with certain inputs it will provide the relevant output as a response.

  

A program that is exposed via an API can be called by other programs on the same network. For example if you have a batch job running in your environment where **Program A** needs some data from **Program B**.

  

If the API for **Program B** is exposed over the internet it will allow users and other systems to gain access to the data it provides.

For example if a user installs and uses a app on their mobile phone and this app needs to access **Program B** to get some data.

From the above examples we can see that API's have the following 3 important characteristics:

 - Standard web protocols
 - Well defined interfaces
 - Network accessible
